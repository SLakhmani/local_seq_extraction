# local_seq_extraction

This is the main script for extraction of local DNA sequences around 6mA sites. The script is written in Visual Basic for Applications to function within Microsoft Excel. It extracts 5 bases upstream and 5 bases downstream of the 6mA sites. 

Input: 
1) Genome file in FASTA format 
2) 6mA positions in positive and negative strands as separate worksheets in the workbook where this script is being implemented. 

Output: 11-mer DNA sequences in a new worksheet of the same MS Excel workbook along with their positions and strand information.
